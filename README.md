In my day job, I am working on my PhD.project on the governance of platform 
economies.

I am also a self-taught software developer, and have created various plugins for
[Neovim](http://neovim.io), [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), and
[Alfred](http://alfredapp.com), including [an award-winning
theme](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus) and [a plugin
featured in the official Alfred plugin store](https://alfred.app/workflows/chrisgrieser/reddit-browser/). 
In addition, I have been an alpha-tester for [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md)
since 2022.
